Expression Calculator

=>> About
This project implements an **infix to postfix expression converter and evaluator** using stacks.  
It handles operators `+ - * / ^` and parentheses.  

=>> How It Works
1. Enter an expression (e.g., `3+(2*5)-9`).  
2. The program converts it to postfix (`3 2 5 * + 9 -`).  
3. Then it evaluates the postfix expression â†’ output = `4`.  

=>> Features
- Uses **stack** for operators and operands.  
- Handles operator precedence.  
- Evaluates expressions correctly.
